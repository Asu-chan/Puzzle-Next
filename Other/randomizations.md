# Using/creating randomizations

## Needed program
[Puzzle Next](https://github.com/N-I-N-0/Puzzle-Next) - recommended at least

## Without a NewerSMBW based mod
If you want to use tile randomization without the use of a so called RandTiles.bin file used in [NewerSMBW](https://newerteam.com/wii/) based mods, you will have to create a tilesetinfo.xml file in the folder `\reggiedata\patches\YOUR PATCH NAME` of the Reggie Next level editor or edit a tilesetinfo.xml from another game version.

## With a NewerSMBW based mod
If you use a NewerSMBW based mod you should have a so called RandTiles.bin file in a folder called `...\NewerRes`. This file contains the same information as the tilesetinfo.xml but is used inside the game instead.

## Convert between tilesetinfo.xml and RandTiles.bin
With Puzzle Next you can open your existing RandTiles.bin file, edit it in the format of the tilesetinfo.xml and export it again. You can import .xml and .bin files and also export to both .xml and .bin files in the RandTiles tab of Puzzle Next.
