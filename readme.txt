This is the Puzzle NSMBW Tileset Editor, updated to work with Python 3 and your choice of either Qt for Python (PySide2) or PyQt5. No other changes are included apart from bug fixes.
The Puzzle NSMBW Tileset Editor was created by Tempus.
The Python 3, Qt-for-Python/PyQt5 porting was done by RoadrunnerWMC.
The program is GNU GPL v2 licensed (see license.txt).

As of 2019, PySide2 is much less stable than PyQt5, especially with the imagery-related classes. As such, PyQt5 is recommended over PySide2 at this time.

The original program can be found at https://github.com/Tempus/Puzzle .
